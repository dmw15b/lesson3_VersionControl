            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a system that lets you track your files over time. If you mess up you can easily get back to a previous working version. This system records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. Version control systems aim to solve a specific problem that programmers face, which would be storing and sharing multiple versions of code files. There are several benefits of a Version Control System and those benefits are: files cannot be overwritten, people can work on the same files at the same time without conflict, files cannot be overwritten, and a Version Control System will backup files so that you won't lose your work or have to start a project over.  </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The most common version control method is to copy files into another directory. It is so simple but it is also error prone due to the fact that you could forget which directory you are in and accidentally write the wrong file or copy over files you do not mean to. Programmers developed Local Version Control Systems (local VCSs) that has simple database that kept all the changes to files under revision control. Another issue is that people need to collaborate with developers on other systems. Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCSs) were developed to deal with this problem. CVCS have a single server that contains all the versioned files, and a number of clients that check out files from that central place.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> In a Distributed Version Control System (DVCSs) clients do not just check out the latest snapshot of their files, they fully mirror the repository. Clients can communicate between each other and maintain their own local branches without having to go through a repository. These systems do not rely on a central server to store all the versions of a project's files. Most programming projects consist mostly of plain text files. Modern systems also compress the files to use even less space. One common error about distributed version control systems is that there cannot be a central project repository. Instead of a central repository being required by the tools you use, it is now optional.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Getting a Git Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">You can get a Git project using two main approaches. The first one takes an exisiting project or directory and imports it into Git. The second clones an existing Git repository from another server. If you track an existing project in Git, you need to go to the project's directory and type: <i> "$ git init"</i>. This creats a new subdirectory named <i>.git</i> that contains all of your necessary repository files. If you want to get a copy of an existing Git repository, the command you need is <i>git clone</i>. Instead of getting a working copy, Git receives a full copy of nearly all data that the server has. Every version of every file for the history of the project is pulled down by default when you run <i>git clone</i>. If your server disk gets corrupted, you can often use nearly any of the clones on any client to set the server back to the state it was in when it was cloned. You clone a repository with <i>git clone [url]</i>.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Basics</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git stores and thinks about information different from Version Control Systems. The big difference between Git and other VCS is how Git thinks about its data. Git thinks of its data more like a set of snapshots of a miniature file system. Every time you commit, or save your project in Git, it takes a picture of what all your files look like at the moment and stores a reference to that snapshot. If files have not changed, Git does not store the file again. Most operations in Git only need local files and resources to operate. It is impossible to change the contents of any file or directory without Git knowing about it. You cannot lose information in transit or get file corruption without Git being able to detect it. When you do actions in Git, mostly all of them only add data to the Git database. You can lose or mess up changes you have not committed yet, but after you commit a snapshot into Git, it is very difficult to lose. Git has three main states that your files can reside in: committed, modified, and staged. Committed means that the data is safely stored in your local database. Modified means that you have changed the file but have not committed it into your database yet. Staged means that you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot. There are three main sections of a Git project: the Git directory, the working directory, and the staging area.</p>
